Submitted by: Christopher Martinez

Time spent: 3 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [yes] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [yes] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
When I added the split feature, it wouldn't work if i already pressed the tip amount. As a temporary fix to this, I added the split feature right after bill amount so that the user would be prompted to enter the split amount before the tip percentage.
